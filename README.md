Odin Recipes Project.

Brief introduction : This project is about building a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main page and five linked webpages where recipes will be displayed. 

Skills I will practice : 
 - using the command line to create and navigate the files for this project.
 - using HTML to create the structure of the pages.
 - using css flexbox for the lay out of the web pages. 
 - using git to add, commit and push my files to local and remote repository.
